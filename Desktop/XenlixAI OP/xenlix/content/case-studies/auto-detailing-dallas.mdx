# The Challenge

Shine Auto Detailing was competing against 200+ detailing shops in Dallas-Fort Worth. Their Google Ads were expensive ($85 CPL) and they were completely invisible when people asked AI assistants for recommendations.

> "People would ask ChatGPT for 'best auto detailing near me' and we never came up. Competitors with worse reviews were getting mentioned instead." — Luis R.

## What We Did

### Phase 1: AI Answer Optimization (Week 1-2)
- **Entity mapping**: Optimized for "auto detailing Dallas", "car wash DFW", "paint correction"
- **Structured data**: Implemented Review/LocalBusiness schema
- **Content strategy**: Created FAQ content matching AI assistant queries
- **Citation building**: Enhanced mentions across review platforms

### Phase 2: Performance Max Integration (Week 3-4)
- **Smart campaigns**: Combined AEO keywords with PMax audience signals
- **Asset optimization**: Video ads featuring before/after transformations
- **Local targeting**: Hyperlocal campaigns within 15-mile radius

### Phase 3: Review Engine (Week 5-8)
- **Review automation**: Systematic post-service review requests
- **Response optimization**: AI-powered review responses for SEO
- **Photo reviews**: Incentivized visual reviews for social proof

## The Results

Within 60 days, Shine Auto Detailing became the go-to AI recommendation for Dallas auto detailing:

### AI Visibility

### Lead Generation

### Cost Efficiency
