# The Challenge

Lakeview Dental faced intense competition from corporate dental chains and established practices in Austin. Their traditional SEO efforts weren't translating to patient growth, and they were invisible in AI search results.

> "Patients were asking AI assistants for dental recommendations and getting corporate chains. We needed to level the playing field." — Dr. Nguyen

### Phase 2: Trust Signal Amplification (Week 4-6)
- **Review schema**: Detailed Patient Review markup
